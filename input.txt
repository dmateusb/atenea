One of the most notorious social engineering attacks in history was Kevin Mitnick's infiltration of Pacific Bell in the nineteen nineties. Mitnick didn't rely on sophisticated hacking tools. Instead, he used psychological manipulation to convince employees to give him access to their systems. He would call technical support, pretending to be an employee who forgot his password, using insider jargon and creating a sense of urgency.

What made Mitnick so successful was his meticulous research. He would learn employee names, department structures, and internal procedures before making a single call. He understood that people are often the weakest link in security. A friendly voice asking for help could bypass millions of dollars worth of security infrastructure.

His tactics included pretexting, where he created elaborate scenarios to gain trust, and baiting, where he would leave infected USB drives in parking lots knowing curious employees would plug them in. Mitnick's eventual capture and transformation into a security consultant proved an important lesson: technical security measures are useless if employees aren't trained to recognize social engineering attacks. Today, his techniques are still used by cybercriminals, making security awareness training more critical than ever.
